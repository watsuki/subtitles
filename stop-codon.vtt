00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.615
Currently, thousands

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:06.935
of known genetic diseases are organized based on which genes

3
00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:08.860
are impacted and the resulting symptoms.

4
00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:12.775
Imagine if there were another way to classify them...

5
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.415
into a few universal diseases with a shared cause...

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.295
a cause that could be addressed with a single medicine.

7
00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:22.695
About 10% of patients

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.735
with a genetic disease have a single type of mutation

9
00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.455
that leads to the presence of a premature termination

10
00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.615
or stop codon that triggers translational machinery

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.215
to stop early and produce an incomplete protein

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.095
that is poorly functional or non-functional, causing disease.

13
00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:45.455
As many as 30 million people worldwide diagnosed

14
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.400
with a variety of genetic diseases have a premature stop codon

15
00:00:49.405 --> 00:00:54.255
and can be classified as having stop codon disease.

16
00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.535
Alltrna is developing engineered tRNA medicines

17
00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.255
that allow translational machinery to read

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.935
through premature termination codons, restoring production

19
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.615
of any affected protein regardless of the disease it causes.

20
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:13.855
As a result, instead of waiting for the development

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.095
of individual therapies for each genetic disease,

22
00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.175
patients across hundreds or thousands of rare

23
00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:23.175
and ultra rare conditions could potentially be treated

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.015
with a single tRNA.
