00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.329
The central dogma describes how DNA is transcribed into mRNA,

2
00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:10.279
which is then translated into a sequence of amino acids that fold into proteins.

3
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.630
Proteins carry out the functions of the cell and, ultimately, life.

4
00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:20.149
It turns out that one critical component in this process has been widely overlooked.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.020
Transfer or tRNAs

6
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.440
tRNAs are naturally designed and modified to transfer an mRNA

7
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.209
encoded amino acid to the growing chain to create the final protein

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.819
product.

9
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.209
Without tRNA,

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.340
it is impossible to make proteins,

11
00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.159
and at Alltrna,

12
00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:47.869
we have deciphered tRNA's vast potential as a new kind of therapeutic to

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.139
treat a broad range of diseases.
